# tinyAppProject

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

The intent of this project is to create an application which can parse a lengthy URL into a much shorter URL.

This is of interest to Twitter users, as a shorter URL means they can include a greater amount of relevant text in their tweets.
