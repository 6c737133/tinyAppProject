# tinyAppProject

This will be my foray into creating a full fledged web application.

The intent of this project will be to create an application which can parse a lengthy URL into a much shorter URL.  This is of interest to Twitter users, as a shorter URL means they can include a greater amount of relevant text in their tweets.

Additionally, we will aim to provide data pertaining to the number of hits that a user-generated 'short' URL has received, so that we can relay that data back to the user.  Such data could give a user an indication as to which content their readers find most engaging.
